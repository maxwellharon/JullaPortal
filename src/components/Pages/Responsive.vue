    v-responsive takes a set of objects
    where the keys are class names and the values are
    functions that take an element and return a boolean.
    If the functions return true, then the classes will be applied.

    In this case, if the component is less than 800 pixels wide,
    the `small` class will be applied.
    If the component is less than 400 pixels wide, both the `small`
    and `tiny` classes will be applied.
